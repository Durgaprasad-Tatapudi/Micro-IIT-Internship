# Micro-IIT-Internship
A sentiment analysis model using TF-IDF &amp; Naïve Bayes, with text preprocessing and real-time sentiment predictions in Python. 

# 🎭 Sentiment Analysis using Naïve Bayes & TF-IDF  

This project implements a **sentiment analysis model** using **TF-IDF vectorization** and a **Multinomial Naïve Bayes classifier**.  
It preprocesses text, removes stopwords, tokenizes sentences, and classifies sentiments as **positive, negative, or neutral**.  
The script also allows **real-time sentiment prediction** via user input.

## 🚀 Features  
✅ **Text Preprocessing** (lowercasing, punctuation & stopword removal)  
📊 **TF-IDF Vectorization** (converts text into numerical features)  
🏆 **Multinomial Naïve Bayes Classifier** (trained on labeled dataset)  
📈 **Train-Test Split (80-20)** for model evaluation  
📊 **Accuracy Score Calculation**  
🔍 **Interactive Sentiment Prediction** (real-time user input)

## 📥 Installation & Setup  

### 1️⃣ **Install Dependencies**  
Ensure Python 3.x is installed, then install required libraries:  
```bash
pip install pandas nltk scikit-learn


###Tic-Tac-Toe Game

imple **3×3 Tic-Tac-Toe** game in Python with **win detection, draw handling, and turn-based two-player gameplay** in the console. 🎮
# 🏆 Tic-Tac-Toe (Python Console Game)

Tic-Tac-Toe is a **classic two-player game** played on a **3×3 grid**. Players take turns marking a square with their symbol (**X or O**) to get **three in a row**—**horizontally, vertically, or diagonally**. The game ends when a player wins or when all squares are filled, resulting in a **draw**.

## 🚀 Features
- 🎮 **Two-player mode** (X and O take turns)
- ✅ **Win detection** (checks rows, columns, and diagonals)
- 🤝 **Draw detection** (when all squares are filled)
- 🔄 **Turn-based gameplay** with player switching
- 🖥️ **User-friendly console interface**
- ❌ **Input validation** (prevents invalid or duplicate moves)
