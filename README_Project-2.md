# 🎮 **Tic-Tac-Toe (Python Console Game)**  

Tic-Tac-Toe is a **classic two-player strategy game** played on a **3×3 grid**. Players take turns placing their symbol (**X or O**) in an empty cell, aiming to align **three in a row**—horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game ends when a player wins, or if all squares are filled, resulting in a **draw**.  

This Python-based console version provides **a smooth and interactive experience** with **real-time input validation and automated win detection**.
